# About
This is a GUI for the CLI tool https://github.com/noarche/ComboScriptPro. The functionality is the same however it works with text boxes instead of input and output text files. 




# Help: 
### The following options are from the .py version of this application. Options have been changed to buttons in the GUI but perform the same task.

        Option 1; To extract all lines for earthlink.net enter @earthlink.net | If you want to extract all .net domains enter .net | This will create text documents named what you enter | When extracting lines are appended and never overwrite.
       
				Option 2; Remove duplicate lines from input.txt & saves to output.txt | Output.txt gets overwritten so always move it or rename it. 
        
				Option 3; Splits Email from Password, saves to extracted_emails.txt(is Overwrite each time you run task) | Good for mailing list or if you need to split for dehashing passwords.
        
				Option 4; Same as option 3 but with passwords, extracted_passwords.txt(is Overwrite each time you run task).
        
				Option 5; Extract URLs from input.txt | Append save to extracted_URL.txt  
        
				Option 6; Organize input.txt A-Z | Overwrite output.txt
        
				Option 7; Use lines from input.txt to name new directorys | Do not use this option unless you have a reason!
        
				Option 8; Extract lines from input.txt if the password is MD5 hashed | Append save to extracted_hashed.txt | Use to create your own private combo that has not been cracked yet | A popular dehashing script is HASHCAT OCL. 
        
				Option 9; Drop files in the directory toCombine that you need to combine | Good idea to remove duplicates after | Overwrite output.txt
        
				Option 10; Enter the number of lines you want to split combo by then name your splits | creates directory to save your splits in.
        
				Option 11; After dehashing your hashed passwords use this to rejoin back with email addresses | The files it looks for to join are extracted_emails.txt and extracted_passwords.txt | overwrite JoinedOutput.txt
        
				Option 12; Strip capture results from combo | append save cleanedOutput.txt
        
				Option 13; Extract all domains by domain to seperate text files | append save
        
				Option 14; Analyze input.txt and display Top Domains, Number of lines, and the % of combo | Only .net domains
        
				Option 15; Analyze input.txt and display Top Domains, Number of lines, and the % of combo | All domains
        
				Option 0; Exit
